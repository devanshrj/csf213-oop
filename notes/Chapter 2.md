## Chapter 2
### Basics
- Object Oriented Programming
	- Abstraction
	- Encapsulation
	- Inheritance
	- Polymorphism

### Java Basics
- The name of the main class should match the name of the file that holds the program.
- Program execution
	- `javac fileName.java`
		- Each class has a file associated with it
		- Creates file `className.class`
		- Bytecode
	- `java className`
		- Program run
- `main()` -> entry point for execution
- `static` allows methods to be called without having to instantiate a particular instance of the class. 
- Code Blocks -> logically link two or more statements
